As we want to maximize the number of happy people, and the shirts can be converted from larger to smaller and not in opposite direction,we will start by
distributing from the largest tshirt to the smallest tshirts.first we distribute the larger shirts according the number of shirts available and the number 
of people and then we convert the remaining to smaller ones and so on till we reach the smallest size.
